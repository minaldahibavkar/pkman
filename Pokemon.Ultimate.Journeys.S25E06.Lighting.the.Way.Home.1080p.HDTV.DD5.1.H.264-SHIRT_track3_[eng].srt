We should have the system
repaired for the next time,

184
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:53,298
so perhaps you should give
Ampharos a little rest for now.

-to Talonflame 2!
-That's for sure!

you can do it again!

that it can't light up at all?

Hm...

210
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,075
Maybe the shock of failing
has sent it into a slump.

211
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:17,549
Ampharos, keep calm, and
I'm sure you'll light up again.

Nothing.

I guess
I'm useless here after all.

222
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,017
What do you mean?

223
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,487
It's because I'm not
Ampharos's real Trainer.

224
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,457
You mean Ampharos belongs
to someone else?

225
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,757
Mm-hm.

226
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,362
Big Mo lent Ampharos to me,
just so I could do this project.

-Big Mo?

230
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,906
The thing is, I was determined
to join the project

231
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,274
and asked Big Mo for help.

232
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:19,878
So that's why he kindly lent
out Ampharos to work with me.

233
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,680
Ampharos was the reason

called me in the first place.

this project a total success.

-[Goh] Sophocles...
-Groo?

237

[Sophocles] I can't do anything
to encourage Ampharos.

238
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,595
If this goes on,
it'll affect everyone's work.

239
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,499
Maybe I should take myself
off the project.

No matter what, you always
give it everything you've got.

242
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,106
[Ash] The reason you wanted in

243
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:51,043
was you wanna become
an astronaut, right?

244

Mm.

It moved to avoid a meteor,

left no time

-Hm?
-I've got an idea!

What is it?

344
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,784
Right now, the light from
Kraibe Observatory can reach it.

345
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:29,688
From there, we alter the course
little by little,

between Anias and Carnahey.

we send the reentry signal,
bringing it back to base.

Hm, yes.
